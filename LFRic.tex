\section{Introduction}
In common with many science applications, Exascale computing presents
a disruptive change for weather and climate models. However, the
difficulty in porting and optimising legacy codes to new hardware is
particular acute for this domain as the software is large ($O(10^6)$
lines of code), takes a long time develop (a decade or more for a new
dynamical core) and is long-lived (typically quarter of a century or longer). These
timescales are much longer than the changes in both processor
architectures and programming models necessary to exploit these
architectures~\cite{gmd-2017-186}. Moreover, highly scalable
algorithms are necessary to exploit the necessary degree of
parallelism Exascale computers are likely exhibit.

In collaboration with academic partners, the Met Office is developing
a new dynamical core, called Gung Ho~\cite{MELVIN2018342}. By
employing a mixed Finite Element Method on an unstructured mesh, the
new dynamical core is designed to maintain the scientific accuracy of
the current Unified Model (UM) dynamical core (ENDGame~\cite{QJ:QJ2235}),
whilst allowing improved scalability by avoiding the singular pole of
the lon-lat grid. A new atmospheric model and software infrastructure,
named LFRic after Lewis Fry Richardson, is being developed to host the
Gung Ho dynamical core, as the the structured, lon-lat grid is inherent in the
data structures of the UM.

The software design is based on a layered architecture and a 
{\em separation of concerns} between the natural science code in which
the mathematics is expressed and the computational science code where the
parallelism and other performance optimisations are expressed. In particular,
there are three layers. The top layer, the algorithm layer, is where high-level mathematical 
operations on global fields are performed. The bottom layer is the kernel layer
where these operations are expressed on a single column of data. In between is the
Parallelisation System or PSy layer, where the horizontal looping and parallelism is
expressed. This abstraction, called PSyKAl, is written in Fortran with Fortran 2003
Object Orientation to encode the rules of the API.
Moreover, a Python code called Psyclone can parse the algorithm and kernel layers and
generate the Psy layer with different target programming models. In effect, the PSyKAl API
and Psyclone are a Domain Specific Embedded Language (DSEL). Natural science code which
conforms to this API can be written in serial and the parallel code is then generated automatically.

The model is under active development and indeed, the science and
numerical analysis are still areas of active research. However, in
order to assess the scientific performance of the model, sufficiently
computationally challenging problems must be tackled. Thus, the
ability to generate optimisations for current architectures is also
required. 

The paper describes the model development and is organised as follows,
the Gung Ho dynamical core and computational aspects are presented in
section~\ref{sec:GH}. The software design for the separation of
concerns and PSKAl API are described are described in
section~\ref{sec:SoC}. The model infrastructure and use of libraries
is discussed in section~\ref{sec:lib}. PSyclone, the code generator is
presented in section~\ref{sec:psyclone}. Finally a scaling analysis is
presented in section~\ref{sec:scal} and conclusions drawn in
section~\ref{sec:con}.

\section{\label{sec:GH}Gung Ho}
A bit about Gung Ho, but mostly the unstructured mesh, quads, 2+1D
mesh, vertically structured. Etc.

\section{\label{sec:SoC}Separation of Concerns}
Science applications in general and weather and climate codes in
particular are written in high-level languages such as Fortran or
C/C++. Indeed, Fortran is commonly employed for weather and climate
codes and can be considered a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for
numerical computation. Using a such a high-level language, an
algorithm is written to solve a mathematical problem without
consideration for the processor architecture. The compiler generates
machine specific instructions and can, in principle, make optimisation
choices to exploit the architecture of different processors.

This abstraction of a separation of concerns between mathematics code
and machine code is powerful and enables both the portability of
science code to different processor architectures and allows the
application to exploit a significant\footnote{What constitutes good
  performance depends on a variety of factors.} fraction of the peak
performance of the processor. Whilst many science applications may
contain code optimisations in performance critical sections, for
example, blocking or tiling loop nests to better utilise cache memory,
in general these applications have relied on clock
speed increases between processor generations to increase performance.

Processor speed increases between generations ceased more than a decade
ago due to the absence of Dennard scaling~\cite{dennard}. Instead,
successive generations of processors have had increasing numbers of processor cores per
socket. Science applications typically have already been adapted to run on multiple
nodes to exploit supercomputers with the distributed memory and data parallelism
typical expressed over MPI. However, multi-core nodes present
additional challenges and heterogenous compute nodes such as
CPU + GPU with distinct memory spaces require additional programming
models. Moreover, the algorithms employed combined with data
parallelism may not be sufficient to exploit this explosion of parallelism.

Many programming models exist, MPI and Partitioned Global Address
Space (PGAS) languages, such as Co Array Fortran, Unified Parallel C,
Chapel and GASPI for distributed memory, new programming languages such
as OpenCL or CUDA and directive based programming models for threaded
and shared memory parallelism such as OpenMP or OpenACC. However,
the programming models lag behind in development of the rapidly evolving computer
architectures and particular models lack feature or processor coverage
making the choice of programming model difficult. This is ambiguity is
especially difficult for weather and climate applications with their long development
cycles. 

Many applications have adopted an MPI + X model, where X is one or
more of the programming models mentioned in the previous paragraph. This
is problematic for several reasons. The programming models are not
only different, they are different types of model. Languages, language
extensions, libraries and directives, some of which are architecture
specific. Worse, the interaction between them is outside the scope of
any model\footnote{Whilst MPI has some level of threaded awareness,
  this is limited.} and may, for example, require the batch scheduling
system to control this. The applications may require a different X for
different architectures and even different data layouts and
loop nest order. All these parallel and performance features
break the data abstraction of the separation of concerns between the
maths/science code and architecture specific code.

The design for the LFRic model is based upon computational science
report from phase 1 of the Gung Ho project~\cite{GHP1_CSR}. By
employing a layered software architecture, the complex parallel code
code can be kept separate from the science code. The software is
separated into three layers. The top layer is the algorithm
layer. Here, algorithms are expressed as operations on global,
data-parallel field objects. The middle layer, termed the
Parallelisation System or PSy layer contains the horizontal looping
and is where the data parallelism is expressed.  The bottom layer is
comprised of the kernels which encode the operation invoked in the
algorithm layer. These operate on a single column of data. 
Shown in figure~\ref{fig:psykal} is a schematic diagram of this
layered software achitecture. The red arrows indicate the control flow
though the different layers. 

\begin{figure}
\centering\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{PSyKAl.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:psykal} Schematic diagram of the PSyKAl layered
  architecture. A single model could be for example, the atmospheric
  model. The blue vertical line between the PSy layer and the
  Algorithm and Kernel layers represents a separation of the science
  and parallel code.}
\end{figure}

The APIs between the layers are tightly controlled. The PSy layer can
only be called from the algorithm layer by an {\em invoke} procedure
call. The permitted arguments to these invoke prodecures are resticted
to be the kernels and the fields that the kernels will operate on. The
kernels can only be called from the PSy layer with the unpacked data
arrays, scalars for loop bounds and supporting arrays of both reals
and integers for Finite Element Method over an unstructured mesh.
These coding rules are enforced by using Fortran 2003 object
orientation coding style to control the APIs. By restricting the
domain of the problem from all numerical mathematics to only that
required (in the first instance) to the Gung Ho dynamical core it is
possible to constrain the parallelism to the PSy layer. By restoring
the separation of concerns between the science code and the
parallel/optimisation code means in principle different programming
models can be employed in the PSy layer without changing the science
code. Moreover, the PSyKAl API can be thought of a Domain Specific
Embedded Language (DSEL).

Compilers in general have to be conservative about the assumptions
they can make in order to guarantee correctness. However, a further
advantage of the domain specific approach is that developers can
explicitly express the domain knowledge which is not possible in a
standard, high level language. In the case of the LFRic model, data
access descriptors are employed to say whether access to a field is
read, write, readwrite or increment. This information is embedded in
Fortran as part of the kernel. Other information encoded in this way
is the loop iterator (for example {\em cells}), whether the kernel
operates on a field which lives on a specific function space, whether
any of the fields live on common function spaces and for FEM kernels
whether the kernel uses any basis functions. 

The restricted domain, strict control of the APIs between layers and
critically, the data access descriptors and other kernel metadata
allow the PSy layer to be constructed entirely according to a set of
rules. The code itself can then be automatically generated. This is
done by a python code parser, transformer and code generator called
PSyclone. More details of PSyclone itself can be found in
section~\ref{sec:psyclone}. The generated code is mostly Fortran.
These are calls to the LFRic infrastructure which might contain the
MPI distributed memory parallelism and calls to the LFRic
infrastructure to dereference the Fortran 2003 objects, looping over
the horizontal mesh elements and calling the kernels
themselves. However, PSyclone can also perform transformations and
target other progamming models such as OpenMP or OpenACC. PSyclone is
then in effect a Domain Specific Embedded compiler. PSyclone also does
one other important code generation function. In the algorithm layers,
the calls to the invoke procedure are replaced with a specific
prodcedure call to the PSy layer. The PSy layer code can then be
optimised depending on the kernels in the invoke and the metadata.

\subsection{Implementation}
The algorithm layer code is written in Fortran 2003. However, this
code is not actually compiled, it is parsed and processed by PSyclone
first. Most of the Fortran is left as written. The exception to this
is the calls to the invoke procedure. This procecedure doesn't
exist. The invoke means {\em execute these kernels looping over the horizontal
mesh}. PSyclone can paralellise this horizontal looping with MPI,
openMP or both. Shown in the code fragment below is an invoke
procedure call from the algorithm layer.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Fortran]
 call invoke(setval_c(v(m), 0.0_r_def), &
             matrix_vector_kernel_type(v(m), s(m), mm), &
             enforce_bc_kernel_type( v(m) ) )
\end{lstlisting}

There are three kernels in this invoke. The first \verb+setval_c+ is
an example of a {\em point-wise} kernel. The same operation is applied
to each degree of freedom so no FEM structure is required. In this
case setting all the values of the field to the same scalar. This is
operation generated in place in the PSy layer by PSyclone. The second
kernel is written as a constructor call to the kernel, so that it is
valid Fortran. The arguments to this call \verb+v+ and \verb+s+ are
{\em fields} and \verb+mm+ is an {\em operator} in this case a mass
matrix.

PSyclone replaces the code for invoke the kernels, with a call to a
generated procedure in the PSy layer with the fields and operators as
arguments. This is shown below
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Fortran]
 CALL invoke_56(v(m), s(m), mm)
\end{lstlisting}

Shown below is a code fragment from the generated PSy layer from for
the invoke shown above.

\end{lstlisting}
Lines 1-20 are the calls to the LFRic infrastructure to pull out
sizes, loop counters, and the indirection maps for the unstructured
mesh. Lines 24-26 are the builtin function generated in place in the
PSy layer for a point-wise operation. Lines 30-36 are the distributed
memory calls to the infrastructure for a halo exchange and
testing/setting flags to indicate whether a halo (and to what depth)
has been updated. Lines 38-45 are the looping over the horizontal mesh
and the procedure call to the kernel itself. The arguments are simple
scalars for sizes and loop counters, the data arrays and (for example)
the indirection maps. 


Shown in the code fragment below is the kernel metadata for the
matrix-vector kernel invoked in the algorithm layer.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Fortran, numbers=left]
type, public, extends(kernel_type) ::  &
                    matrix_vector_kernel_type
  private
  type(arg_type) :: meta_args(3) = (/ &
       arg_type(GH_FIELD,    GH_INC,  ANY_SPACE_1), &
       arg_type(GH_FIELD,    GH_READ, ANY_SPACE_2), &
       arg_type(GH_OPERATOR, GH_READ, ANY_SPACE_1, &
       ANY_SPACE_2)  /)
  integer :: iterates_over = CELLS
contains
  procedure, nopass ::matrix_vector_code
end type
\end{lstlisting}
The metadata is embedded in Fortran so that no special comments or
other mark-up is required. The access descripters shown above are key
to deriving the appropriate rules for generating the code in the PSy
layer. The \verb+arg_type+ has three components. Firstly, the type of
the data object, in this case fields and operators\footnote{An
  operator is a mapping between one function space and another.}. Secondly, what is
the data acess pattern for this data object, {\em e.g.} \verb+GH_INC+ means the data is
incremented. Thirdly, which function space the data lives on. In this case, the
kernel is general and can operate over any space, hence, the
\verb+any_space_n+. Whilst the $n$ can be any, the function space of the
first field must correspond to the first function space of the operator and the
function space of second field must correspond to the second function
space of the operator.

\section{\label{sec:lib}Infrastructure}

As shown in figure~\ref{fig:psykal}, the PSyKAl layered
architecture is supported by the LFRic infrastructure. This provides
functionality such as distributed memory support (halo exchanges),
colouring for OpenMP threading and the provision of loop bounds that the
generated Psy layer will use.

\begin{figure}
\centering\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{infrastructure_objects.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:objects} Schematic diagram of the structural
hierarchy used in the LFRic infrastructure to support the field object}
\end{figure}

Within the development of LFRic there has been a conscious effort to
provide the infrastructure following an object-orientated approach. As
such, much of the infrastructure is provided through a hierarchy of
objects that culminates in the field object that is used within the
science code. The hierarchy of objects is shown in
figure~\ref{fig:objects}. Two-dimensional topological and positional
information about the global mesh is read into the global model object.
This is passed to a partitioner to generate a partition object that
describes what portion of the global mesh the local processing element
will be working on. The global mesh and the partition objects are then
combined to form a mesh object that extrudes the two-dimensional mesh
information in the vertical for just the part of the mesh that will be
used on the local processing element to form a local, three-dimensional
representation of the mesh. The way the data that is held within the
field object, relates to the mesh is described by the function space.

Most of the infrastructure is accessed through the field object. So, for
example if a halo exchange is required on a field, the halo exchange
method on the field object is called. This infrastructure application
programming interface (API) is used by the PSy layer to access
information and functionality.

\subsection{\label{sec:distmem}Distributed Memory Optimisation}

Distributed memory parallelism is achieved by partitioning the full
(global) domain into smaller sections (partitioned or local domains).
Information is passed between the tasks through the use of halo regions.
Data in these areas are provided from other partitions that own that
section of the domain.

Performing halo exchanges is not unique to LFRic. Running large parallel
model codes has been done for many years, using halo exchanges as a
method of providing communication between partitions. The LFRic
infrastructure has a data model with significant differences to many
older models which will affect the way distributed memory parallelism is
implemented:

\begin{enumerate}

\item LFRic is designed to support horizontally unstructured meshes,
which means it has to support non-uniform shaped partitions with complex
shaped halo regions.

\item Because the domain is horizontally unstructured, moving from one
data point to a horizontally adjacent data point requires using a lookup
table, which is slower than using direct addressing. In order to recover
some code performance, fields are laid out in memory so that vertically
adjacent data points are next to each other, which means that, for
optimisation reasons, the looping structure within LFRic is k-innermost.

\item LFRic supports a finite-element formulation which means that data
are held as ``degrees of freedom'' (dofs) on all the different
entities within the mesh: cell volumes, faces, edges and vertices.
Partitioning the domain along cell boundaries will always lead to
partitions which need to share data values. Sharing data makes assigning
ownership of that data, and therefore, halo swapping more complex.

\end{enumerate}

The halo exchanges are achieved by passing information between processes
using MPI. For performance and ease of use reasons, the MPI library is
not called directly, instead a wrapper is used. At initialisation time,
the wrapper library pre-generates the communication routing tables
required to perform a halo exchange, which are then reused every time a
halo exchange is required.

In order to generate the routing table, each rank needs to supply the
following information to the library:

\begin{itemize}

\item A list of all the global dof ids of all the locally owned dofs

\item A list of all the global dof ids of all the dofs in the increasing
levels of halo depth 

\end{itemize}

Initially, the LFRic project used the infrastructure library component
of the Earth System Modelling Framework (ESMF)~\cite{ESMFDocs} to
provide the layer between the model and MPI, but it wasn't particularly
well suited to the particular problem it was being used for. Although
routing tables it generated were optimal (the halo exchanges called
during timestepping were very fast), the time to generate the tables
became quite long when the model was run at scale. The design of the
model framework to support the `separation of concerns' led to all the
halo exchange functionality being neatly encapsulated in the PSy layer.
This made it relatively easy to try a different library to provide the
intermadiate layer. A switch was made to use the YAXT (Yet Another
eXchange Tool)~\cite{YAXTDocs} library written by DKRZ. This provides
halo exchanges during time stepping that are as fast as those provided
by ESMF, but the time taken to initialise the routing tables is must
shorter. 

The API for supporting distributed memory optimisation is very simple. A
halo exchange function is provided on every field and a flag is
maintained by the infrastructure to track whether data held in the halo
cells is up to date with the owner of that data (`clean' halos) or
whether a parallel computation has updated the field on the owning
partition and the local halos are out of date (`dirty' halos). When the
Psy layer determines that a halo exchange may be required, it first
checks the state of the halos and if they are `dirty' it calls the halo
exchange functionality.

\subsection{\label{sec:sharedmem}Shared Memory Optimisation}

As with all the parallelisation within LFRic, the shared memory
parallelism is implemented within the Psy layer. The directives used to
implement the shared memory parallelism are inserted into the PSy layer
code. The finite-element formulation makes use of data on mesh entities
shared by more than one cell. That means that two threads working on
different cells may try writing to a dof shared between the cells at the
same time. In order to prevent these write contentions, the mesh is
split into collections of cells such that there can be no write
contentions within a collection, so calculations on the cells within a
collections can be run in parallel. Each of these parallel collections
are then run sequentially and there are no write contentions. The
collections are often named after different colours, so the process is
known a mesh colouring. The information and functionality to support
colouring within the shared memory parallelism is provided by the LFRic
infrastructure.

When the mesh object is created, it is is coloured by the infrastructure
and information about the colouring is stored, so it can be used from
within the PSy layer. Infrastructure provides the number of colours,
the number of cells in each colour and which cells are present in each
colour. Shared memory parallel directives are placed in the Psy layer
and the looping can be made safe using the colouring information
provided by the infrastructure. 

\subsection{\label{sec:io}Parallel I/O}

A consequence of models running over many thousands of cores is a requirement
for scalable parallel I/O. A computationally optimised model is of little practical
operational use if I/O then becomes a limiting factor. The LFRic project has
decided to investigate options for I/O alongside the computational
and infrastructure development for three main reasons. Firstly, the requirement
to be able to run science assessment jobs on large numbers of cores and obtain the
output efficiently. Secondly, a key aim of LFRic is scalability and therefore it is
helpful to be able to monitor the impact of I/O on this as the infrastructure and
science develops. Thirdly, LFRic is making some fundamental changes that impact the
underlying mesh and this links to I/O in terms of input / output file formats. Having
a concrete idea of what these file formats will be in the future enables LFRic to
inform future users internal and external to the Met Office.

Although developing a bespoke I/O system was a possibility, the decision was
made early on to adopt an existing parallel I/O framework and leverage knowledge and
experience from the community; developing Earth System Models is becoming increasingly
complex and challenging for any one organisation to develop and maintain all the required
components~\cite{gmd-2017-186}.
As of early 2016, when the first scoping work for LFRic parallel I/O was being done,
there were several existing parallel I/O frameworks and XIOS was selected as the prime
candidate for evaluation~\cite{XIOSWiki}. A discussion of the other frameworks and why
they were not considered can be found in~\cite{Adams2018}.

XIOS was an obvious choice for LFRic as it was a mature framework, having had many years
of development and was already in use in the weather and climate domain. For example,
the Orchidee land surface model, the Dynamico dynamical core (part of the LMD-Z
Atmosphere model) and in the NEMO ocean model. NEMO is used in Met Office coupled
models so there was some existing experience with XIOS. In terms of potential scalability,
XIOS had also been proved to run successfully in models running on the order of 10,000
cores. Crucially for climate models, XIOS works with the OASIS coupling framework that
is commonly used in coupled climate models including the UM. 

The key features of XIOS can be summarised as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Flexible definition of I/O workflows via external XML files
  \item Client/Server architecture allowing asynchronous I/O servers on dedicated cores
  \item Sophisticated "in situ" post-processing via workflows defined in the XML file(s) 
\end{enumerate}

XIOS is written in C++, but also provides a Fortran API to developers. It makes use of
MPI-IO and the NetCDF4 and HDF5 libraries and handles unstructured and regular grids.
XIOS is a client-server framework where I/O servers are asynchronous processes buffering
output requests from client processes. XIOS also has sophisticated post-processing
functionality - e.g. for regridding, time series, meaning. The output schedule and
file format are defined by an XML file which hides a lot of complexity from the user.

Prior to 2016, XIOS only supported read and write of NetCDF file formats that follow the CF
conventions.  As previously explained in section~\ref{sec:GH}, the LFRic implementation uses
semi-structured meshes and a FEM formulation, where variables are held on
different elements of the mesh (nodes, edges or faces). Therefore, the I/O system needs to
handle data structured in this way. The UGRID-NetCDF format has been chosen as the main
LFRic input mesh format and also output format for diagnostics and model dumps~\cite{UgridSpec}.
In the UGRID convention the topology of the underlying unstructured mesh is stored as well as
data, and data can be defined on any of the mesh elements: nodes, edges, or faces.
Working in collaboration with IPSL (Institut Pierre Simon LaPlace), the ability to write the
UGRID format was added to XIOS in 2016 in order to support LFRic. 

XIOS has been integrated into LFRic via a lightweight I/O interface so
that (as far as possible) the underlying I/O framework is hidden and
could be replaced by an alternative.  The I/O interface is designed to
be compatible with the use of Fortran 2003 Object Orientation in
LFRic. The field object (see figure~\ref{fig:objects}) contains read and write
interface declarations that use Fortran procedure pointers to define
I/O 'behaviours'. When a field is created the behaviours are set by
pointing to a specific reading or writing method. Writing a field just
involves calling \verb+field%write_field()+ - {\em i.e.}, it is the
responsibility of the field to write itself and how the writing is
actually done is hidden.

More details of the experimental results of the LFRic-XIOS integration work can be
found in~\cite{Adams2018} where preliminary results on I/O scalability (up to 13824 
processors) and XIOS and Lustre performance tuning are presented. The conclusions of
this work were that XIOS is an effective parallel I/O framework that was technically
straightforward to integrate into the existing LFRic infrastructure via the XIOS
Fortran interface. Scaling experiments showed that XIOS performance was scaleable with
respect to increasing numbers of cores, even with minimal tuning.

\section{\label{sec:psyclone}PSyclone}

As discussed earlier, PSyclone~\cite{psyclone} is a domain-specific
compiler which, given an Algorithm and associated Kernels, generates
the code for the middle, PSy layer. Currently, each of these layers
must be in Fortran as this remains a popular choice for scientific
developers in the earth-system modelling domain. However, there is
nothing in the approach to prevent other languages being targetted in
future.

\subsection{Design}

The language of the DSL which PSyclone compiles is embedded within
Fortran and consists of two parts. The first is a way of specifying
the computational kernels to be executed and in what order.  The
Algorithm developer provides this information by writing one or more
calls to a fictional (non-existant) `invoke' subroutine with the
desired kernels as arguments, e.g.:
\begin{lstlisting}
use kernel1_mod, only: kernel1_type
...
call invoke(kernel1_type(field1, field2), &
            kernel2_type(field2, field3))
\end{lstlisting}
(This is valid Fortran because `\lstinline!kernel1_type(field1,field2)!' is
actually a structure constructor.) Note that this Fortran
is never actually compiled by a Fortran compiler (and hence the `invoke'
does not need to exist). PSyclone will produce a modified version of this
code with a call to a real, generated subroutine in the PSy layer.

The second part of the language is a way of describing the
requirements of each kernel (essentially the properties of the kernel;
inputs, outputs and the iteration space). This information is
provided as meta-data (again, valid Fortran) that must reside in the
Fortran module containing the kernel source.

PSyclone is also able to support recognised standard kernel names that
do not require a kernel implementation to be provided and instead
their code is generated. These kernels are termed `builtins'.

Figure~\ref{fig:psyclone-arch} shows the data flow within the PSyclone
architecture.  Starting from the left, the Algorithm is parsed (using
fparser, a pure Python implementation of a Fortran parser) and any
`invoke' calls identified. The list of kernels (and their arguments)
associated with each of these calls is then stored. For each Invoke,
the Fortran modules containing the kernel code (as identified by
\texttt{use} statements) are parsed and the meta-data for each kernel
extracted.

\begin{figure}
\centering\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{psyclone_flow.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:psyclone-arch}Data flow within the PSyclone architecture.}
\end{figure}

PSyclone must then perform two tasks: first, generate an internal
representation (`schedule') of a PSy-layer routine for each Invoke in
the Algorithm. If distributed memory is specified then this schedule
must include appropriate halo exchanges and global sums to ensure
correct execution. Second, PSyclone must modify the supplied Algorithm
code and replace each `call invoke' with a call to the corresponding
routine in the PSy layer. This latter task is achieved by modifying
the fparser-produced Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the Algorithm and
then re-generating Fortran from the new AST.

If no transformations are being applied (see below) to the PSy-layer
schedule(s) then all that remains is for the PSy generator to create
Fortran code.  The steps involved in generating a vanilla
(un-optimised) PSy-layer subroutine are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Generate the unique list of arguments required by all kernels
  in the Invoke;
\item Generate Fortran which queries the LFRic infrastructure to get
  information on the sizes of the various iteration spaces (number of cells,
  vertical levels, dofs etc.);
\item Generate Fortran which queries the LFRic infrastructure to get the
  various look-up tables (e.g. for identifying the dofs belonging to a
  given cell);
\item Generate Fortran which dereferences the various field and operator
  objects to get the necessary data arrays;
\item For each kernel in the Invoke:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Generate a loop over the correct iteration space (cells or dofs);
    \item Generate a call to the kernel subroutine with all necessary arguments.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

As mentioned earlier, since the Algorithm deals with global objects
(fields, operators etc.)  and a kernel deals with e.g. individual
columns of cells, the PSy layer must also account for the fact that
the global objects are in fact decomposed over MPI processes by the
LFRic infrastructure. PSyclone must therefore ensure that global sums
are placed appropriately and that the halos of any fields read by a
given kernel are up-to-date before that kernel is executed. Initially
clean halos were implemented simply by generating code that, at
runtime, marked any field written to by a kernel as having a dirty
halo (using the LFRic infrastructure). Prior to each kernel call code
was also inserted that, for each field with a halo access, performed a
halo swap if the halo was dirty. Subsequently, dependence analysis has
been added and now only those halo exchanges that are known to be
required are inserted ~\cite{psyclone}.

The PSyclone approach and the {PS}y{KA}l separation of concerns is
heavily influenced by the OP2 system~\citep{OP2, PYOP2}. The calls
that specify parallelism in both approaches are similar in terms of
where they are placed in the code and in their semantics. However,
PSyclone supports the specification of more than one kernel in a
parallel region of code, compared with one for OP2, giving more scope
for optimisation. Unlike OP2, PSyclone also takes responsibility for
adding halo exchanges and global sums. For a comparison of {PS}y{KA}l
with other, similar approaches please see~\cite{nemolite2d_psykal}.

\subsection{Transformations}

The large variety in existing computer architectures, the number of
different compilers and the fact that all of these are constantly
evolving means that it is simply not possible to write or generate a
single source code that will be (and continue to be) performance
portable~\cite{shallow_psykal, nemolite2d_psykal}.  It is also very
difficult to create a system that is automatically able to create
performant code for such a range of conditions. PSyclone therefore
seeks to be a tool for the HPC expert, enabling them to apply the
optimisations that, thanks to their experience and knowledge, they
know to be beneficial for a particular architecture and/or compiler.

The application of optimisations is achieved by applying
PSyclone-provided transformations to the schedule of an Invoke.  For
instance, in order to parallelise a give schedule using OpenMP
PSyclone provides transformations to create a parallel region and
introduce various forms of work-sharing construct. Unfortunately,
work-sharing of loops over cells for kernels which update quantities
on horizontally-continuous function spaces will result in race
conditions where multiple threads attempt to write to the same dof. It
is therefore necessary to control the iteration space in order to
prevent these race conditions and PSyclone provides a loop-colouring
transformation for this purpose.

Although PSyclone transformations may be applied within a Python
interactive session, they will typically be used during the
compilation phase of a potentially large application. Therefore,
PSyclone allows (Python) transformation scripts to be supplied
on the command line. As an example, the following simple script is sufficient
to add OpenMP parallelism to the whole LFRic code base:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
def trans(psy):
    ''' Applies PSyclone colouring & OpenMP transformations. '''
    ctrans = Dynamo0p3ColourTrans()
    otrans = Dynamo0p3OMPLoopTrans()
    oregtrans = OMPParallelTrans()

    # Loop over all of the Invokes in the PSy object
    for invoke in psy.invokes.invoke_list:

        schedule = invoke.schedule

        # Colour loops over cells unless they are on discontinuous
        # spaces (W3, WTHETA and W2V) or over dofs
        for loop in schedule.loops():
            if loop.iteration_space == "cells" \
                and loop.field_space.orig_name \
                    not in DISCONTINUOUS_FUNCTION_SPACES:
                schedule, _ = ctrans.apply(loop)

        # Add OpenMP to loops unless they are over colours
        for loop in schedule.loops():
            if loop.loop_type != "colours":
                schedule, _ = oregtrans.apply(loop)
                schedule, _ = otrans.apply(loop, reprod=True)
    return psy
\end{lstlisting}
Here, the `psy' object contains PSyclone's internal represenation of
the PSy layer that it will generate. The script takes this, modifies
it using transformations and then returns it.

\subsection{Example}

In this section, the operation of PSyclone is illustrated by way of
an example extracted from the LFRic code base.

As already described, PSyclone draws from both the Algorithm and
Kernel source in order to reason about the PSy code to be generated.
In the Algorithm, kernels that are to be executed in parallel are
provided as the arguments to an \texttt{invoke} call:

\begin{lstlisting}
call invoke(                                                  &
   setval_c( grad_p, 0.0_r_def ),                             &
   scaled_matrix_vector_kernel_type(grad_p, p, div_star,      &
                                    hb_inv, u_normalisation), &
   enforce_bc_kernel_type( grad_p ),                          &
   apply_variable_hx_kernel_type(l_p, grad_p, mt_lumped_inv,  &
                                 p, compound_div, p3theta,    &
                                 ptheta2, m3_exner_star, one) )
\end{lstlisting}

The \texttt{setval\_c} kernel is an example of one of the builtin
kernels described earlier i.e. one where PSyclone generates the kernel
code rather than it being implemented by a user.

The arguments to these kernels are either scalar quantities or
derived types representing fields or operators, e.g.:

\begin{lstlisting}
! For applying lhs
type(field_type), private :: grad_p, l_p
\end{lstlisting}

The kernel source must include appropriate meta-data describing the
kernel arguments, the iteration space and the name of the routine
that actually implements the kernel:
\begin{lstlisting}
type, public, extends(kernel_type) :: apply_variable_hx_kernel_type
  private
  type(arg_type) :: meta_args(9) = (/                  &
      arg_type(GH_FIELD,    GH_WRITE, W3),             &
      arg_type(GH_FIELD,    GH_READ,  W2),             &
      arg_type(GH_FIELD,    GH_READ,  Wtheta),         &
      arg_type(GH_FIELD,    GH_READ,  W3),             &
      arg_type(GH_OPERATOR, GH_READ,  W3,     W2),     &
      arg_type(GH_OPERATOR, GH_READ,  W3,     Wtheta), &
      arg_type(GH_OPERATOR, GH_READ,  Wtheta, W2),     &
      arg_type(GH_OPERATOR, GH_READ,  W3,     W3),     &
      arg_type(GH_REAL,     GH_READ)                   &
      /)
  integer :: iterates_over = CELLS
contains
  procedure, nopass :: apply_variable_hx_code
end type
\end{lstlisting}
In this example the \texttt{apply\_variable\_hx} kernel writes to a field on the
W3 function space and reads from fields on the W2, W3 and Wtheta
function spaces. It also reads from three local-matrix assembly operators.
Since \texttt{iterates\_over} is \texttt{CELLS}, PSyclone will generate code
to call this kernel for each cell in the 2D domain:
\begin{lstlisting}
DO cell=1,mesh%get_last_edge_cell()
  !
  CALL apply_variable_hx_code(cell, nlayers, l_p_proxy%data, &
    grad_p_proxy%data, mt_lumped_inv_proxy%data, p_proxy%data, &
    compound_div_proxy%ncell_3d, compound_div_proxy%local_stencil, &
    p3theta_proxy%ncell_3d, p3theta_proxy%local_stencil, &
    ptheta2_proxy%ncell_3d, ptheta2_proxy%local_stencil, &
    m3_exner_star_proxy%ncell_3d, m3_exner_star_proxy%local_stencil, &
    one, ndf_w3, undf_w3, map_w3(:,cell), ndf_w2, undf_w2, &
    map_w2(:,cell), ndf_wtheta, undf_wtheta, map_wtheta(:,cell))
END DO 
\end{lstlisting}
Note that the generated code `unpacks' the derived types so as to
provide raw arrays to the kernel subroutine. It also provides look-up
tables (`maps') and dof counts for each of the function spaces used by
the kernel. 

The kernel itself is then responsible for iterating over the cells
within a column. For instance, a fragment of the
\texttt{apply\_variable\_hx\_code} subroutine looks like:
\begin{lstlisting}
! Compute Pt2 * u
do k = 0, nlayers-1
  do df = 1, ndf_w2  
    x_e(df) = x(map_w2(df)+k)
  end do
  ik = (cell-1)*nlayers + k + 1
    
  t_e = matmul(pt2(:,:,ik),x_e)
  do df = 1,ndf_wt
    t(map_wt(df)+k) = t(map_wt(df)+k) + t_e(df)
  end do
end do
\end{lstlisting}
where the outer loop is over levels in the extruded mesh.

Finally, the original Invoke call in the Algorithm is re-written as:
\begin{lstlisting}
CALL invoke_7(grad_p, p, div_star, hb_inv, u_normalisation, l_p, &
              mt_lumped_inv, compound_div, p3theta, ptheta2,   &
              m3_exner_star, one)
\end{lstlisting}
where `invoke\_7' is the name of the generated PSy-layer subroutine.

Since the argument list of a kernel subroutine can quickly become long
and complicated, PSyclone also provides a kernel-stub generator. Given
kernel meta-data, this tool generates a skeleton Fortran subroutine
with all of the necessary arguments declared. The kernel developer
then need only implement the body of the kernel.

\section{\label{sec:Solver}Linear solvers and preconditioners}
Iterative solvers for large sparse linear systems of equations are
required in several places in the model. For example, since mass
matrices in the finite element discretisation are not diagonal, they
need to be inverted with a small number of iterations of a Krylov
subspace method. More importantly, the semi-implicit time-stepping
approach requires the solution of a very large sparse system for all
prognostic unknowns in each step of the non-linear Picard
iteration. Since the system is ill-conditioned, it needs to be
preconditioned efficiently. This is achieved by the (approximate)
reduction to an elliptic system for the pressure, which is
preconditioned with a tensor-product multigrid algorithm
\cite{Borm2001} (see Section \ref{sec:preconditioner}). To increase
efficiency, the pressure preconditioner can be wrapped in its own
iterative solver for the Helmholtz system. Note that in contrast to
the approach already employed in the ENDGame model \cite{QJ:QJ2235},
an outer iteration over the full system is still required due to the
non-diagonal nature of the finite element mass matrices. Altogether
this results in a rather complex solver.
\subsection{Solver infrastructure}
To allow easy implementation of sophisticated nested iterative solvers
and preconditioners, a dedicated abstraction was developed by using
advanced object oriented features of Fortran 2003. This approach
follows similar design philosophies in widely used linear algebra
libraries such as PETSc \cite{Balay1997,Balay2018} and DUNE-ISTL
\cite{Blatt2007}. More specifically, the implementation in LFRic uses
derived types which realise the following operations (see
Fig. \ref{fig:class_hierarchy}, left):
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Vector} types which support common linear algebra
  operations such as AXPY $y\mapsto y+\alpha x$ and dot products
  $x,y\mapsto s = \langle x,y\rangle$. The most important vector-type
  is \texttt{field\_vector}, which contains a collection of model
  fields.
\item \textbf{Linear operator} types which implement the operation $x\mapsto y=Ax$ for vectors $x$ and $y$
\item \textbf{Preconditioners} which approximately solve the system $Px=b$ for a
  given right hand side $b$ and some operator $P\approx A$
\item \textbf{Iterative solvers} which solve the system $Ax=b$ with a
  Krylov-subspace method for a given right hand side $b$. Currently
  supported solvers include Conjugate Gradient, GMRES and BiCGStab.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{class_hierarchy.pdf}
    \hfill
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{class_concrete.pdf}
    \caption{Derived class hierarchy for solvers and preconditioners
      in LFRic (left) and concrete implementation for the linear
      system in implicit time-stepping (right).}
    \label{fig:class_hierarchy}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
Each of those types is derived from an abstract base type. The
iterative solver types operate on generic vector types and are passed
preconditioner and linear operator objects which adhere to the
interface of their abstract base types.  This implies that only one
instance of a particular Krylov method has to be implemented in the
code. Apart from avoiding code duplication, this increases reliability
and maintainability, since only one instance of each solver has to be
developed and tested. In addition, it allows easy ``plug-and-play'' to
explore the space of all possible solver/preconditioner combinations
to achieve optimal performance.

To solve a particular problem, the user has to develop bespoke derived
types for the corresponding linear operator and preconditioners. Note
that the \texttt{apply()} methods of those derived types contain
invoke calls to kernels, which guarantees optimal performance of the entire
model. For example, to construct a solver for the implicit linar
system which is inverted in every semi-implicit time-step, the user
implements the following objects (see Fig. \ref{fig:class_hierarchy},
right):
\begin{itemize}
\item A linear operator type which applies the full linear system to
  all components of a \texttt{field\_vector}.
\item A preconditioner type which reduces the full linear system to
  the (approximate) Schur complement in pressure space by lumping the
  velocity mass matrix; this preconditioner then calls the solver for
  the pressure (Helmholtz-) system.
\item A linear operator type which applies the Helmholtz-operator for
  the pressure system.
\item A preconditioner type which approximately inverts the Helmholtz
  operator (see section \ref{sec:preconditioner}).
\end{itemize}
Once implemented, those linear operators/preconditioners need to be
passed to suitable existing linear solvers.

In addition to this more traditional approximate Schur-complement
approach for solving the full linear system, the development of
solvers based on a hybridisation approach is currently explored. Since
an exact Schur-complement can be formed in this case, hybridisation
avoids the expensive iteration over the full linear system, and
potentially leads to significant improvements in performance.
\subsection{\label{sec:preconditioner}Preconditioner}
To precondition the strongly anisotropic Helmholtz-operator for the
pressure system, the tensor-product multigrid approach in
\cite{Borm2001} is used in LFRic. This is a more advanced solver than
the current tridiagonal vertical-only preconditioner in the ENDGame
model. The multigrid algorithm currently being developed in LFRic has been tested
extensively for representative elliptic equations in atmospheric
modelling in \cite{Mueller2014,Dedner2016}, including a mixed-finite
element discretisation of a linear gravity wave system in
\cite{Mitchell2016}. The key idea to address the strong vertical
anisotropy due to the high-aspect ratio of the domain is to combine
vertical-only smoothing (line relaxation) with a horizontal multigrid
hierarchy. To allow the easy construction of the vertical-only
operators in the Schur-complement from the finite element
discretisation of the full equations, a suitable operator algebra was
developed in \cite{Mitchell2016} and tested in the Firedrake
library. For horizontally discontinuous function spaces (such as the
pressure space and the vertical-only velocity), operators can be
assembled into a partially assembled matrix type, which stores all
couplings within one vertical column. Matrices of this type can be
multiplied, added and, most importantly, inverted in the tridiagonal
solvers which realises the vertical line relaxation. This allows the
high-level construction of the building blocks required for the
Helmholtz-solver and preconditioner. The same data structures were
implemented as derived Fortran 2003 types in the LFRic code and form
the building blocks of the tensor-product multigrid preconditioner for
the elliptic Helmholtz system.

Compared to simpler preconditioners, which do not combine vertical
line relaxation with a horizontal multigrid hierarchy, the
tensor-product multigrid approach typically reduces the solution time
of the pressure system by a factor of at least two
\cite{Mueller2014,Mitchell2016}. However, since the Helmholtz system
contains a zero-order term, only a small number ($\approx 3-4$) of
multigrid levels is required (independent of the grid
resolution). This greatly increases scalability since it avoids global
couplings which arise on the coarsest level.
