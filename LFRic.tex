\section{Introduction}
In common with many science applications, Exascale computing presents
a disruptive change for weather and climate models. However, the
difficulty in porting and optimising legacy codes to new hardware is
particular acute for this domain as the software is large ($O(10^6)$
lines of code), takes a long time develop (a decade or more for a new
dynamical core) and is long-lived (typically quarter of a century or longer). These
timescales are much longer than the changes in both processor
architectures and programming models necessary to exploit these
architectures~\cite{gmd-2017-186}. Moreover, highly scalable
algorithms are necessary to exploit the necessary degree of
parallelism Exascale computers are likely exhibit.

In collaboration with academic partners, the Met Office is developing
a new dynamical core, called Gung Ho~\cite{MELVIN2018342}. By
employing a mixed Finite Element Method on an unstructured mesh, the
new dynamical core is designed to maintain the scientific accuracy of
the current Unified Model (UM) dycore (ENDGame~\cite{QJ:QJ2235}),
whilst allowing improved scalability by avoiding the singular pole of
the lon-lat grid. A new atmospheric model and software infrastructure,
named LFRic after Lewis Fry Richardson, is being developed to host the
Gung Ho dynamical core, as the the structured, lon-lat grid is inherent in the
data structures of the UM.

The software design is based on a layered architecture and a 
{\em separation of concerns} between the natural science code in which
the mathematics is expressed and the computational science code where the
parallelism and other performance optimisations are expressed. In particular,
there are three layers. The top layer, the algorithm layer, is where high-level mathematical 
operations on global fields are performed. The bottom layer is the kernel layer
where these operations are expressed on a single column of data. In between is the
Parallelisation System or PSy layer, where the horizontal looping and parallelism is
expressed. This abstraction, called PSyKAl, is written in Fortran with Fortran 2003
Object Orientation to encode the rules of the API.
Moreover, a Python code called Psyclone can parse the algorithm and kernel layers and
generate the Psy layer with different target programming models. In effect, the PSyKAl API
and Psyclone are a Domain Specific Embedded Language (DESL). Natural science code which
conforms to this API can be written in serial and the parallel code is then generated automatically.

The model is under active development and indeed, the science and
numerical analysis are still areas of active research. However, in
order to assess the scientific performance of the model, sufficiently
computationally challenging problems must be tackled. Thus, the
ability to generate optimisations for current architectures is also
required. 

The paper is organised as follows, the Gung Ho dynamical core and
computational aspects are presented in section~\ref{sec:GH}. The
software design for the separation of concerns and PSKAl API are described 
are described in section~\ref{sec:SoC}. The model infrastructure and
use of libraries is discussed in section~\ref{sec:lib}. PSyclone, the
code generator is presented in section~\ref{sec:Psyclone}. Finally a
scaling analysis is presented in section~\ref{sec:scal} and
conclusions drawn in section~\ref{sec:con}.

\section{\label{sec:SoC}Separation of Concerns}
Science applications in general and weather and climate codes in
particular are written in high-level languages such as Fortran or
C/C++. Indeed, Fortran is commonly employed for weather and climate
codes and can be considered a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for
numerical computation. Using a such a high-level language, an
algorithm is written to solve a mathematical problem without
consideration for the processor archictecture. The compiler generates
machine specific instructions and can, in principle, make optimisation
choices to exploit the architecture of different processors.

This abstraction of a separation of concerns between mathematics code
and machine code is powerful and enables both the portability of
science code to different processor architectures and allows the
application to exploit a significant\footnote{What constitutes good
  performance depends on a variety of factors.} fraction of the peak
performance of the processor. Whilst many science applications may
contain code optimisations in performance critical sections, for
example, blocking or tiling loop nests to bet utilise cache memory,
the code, in general these applications have relied on clock
speed increases between processor generations to increase performance.

Processor speed increases between generation ceased more than a decade
ago due to the abscence of Dennard scaling~\cite{dennard}. Instead,
processors have had increasing numbers of processor cores per
socket. Science applications had already adapted to run on mutliple
node supercomputers with the distributed memory, data parallelism
typical expressed over MPI. However, multi-core nodes present
additional challenges and heterogenous compute nodes such as
CPU + GPU with distinct memory spaces require additional programming
models. Moreover, the algortithms employed combined with data
parallelism may not be suffient to exploit this explosion of parallelism.

Many programming models exist, MPI and Partitioned Global Address
Space (PGAS) languages, such as Co Array Fortran, Unified Parallel C,
Chapel and GASPI for distributed memory, new programming languages such
as OpenCL or CUDA and directive based programming models for threaded
and shared memory parallelism such as OpenMP or OpenACC. However,
the programming models lag the rapidily evolving computer
architectures and particular models lack feature or processor coverage
making the choice of programming model difficult. This is especially
true for weather and climate applications with their long development
cycles. 

Many applications have adopted an MPI + X model, where X is one
or more of the programming models mention in the previous
paragraph. This is problematic for several reasons. The programming
models are not only different, they are different types of
model. Languages, language extensions, libraries and directives, some
are architecure specific. Worse, the interaction between them is
outside the scope of any model\footnote{Whilst MPI has some level of
  threaded awareness, this is limited.} and may for example depend on
the batch scheduling system. The applications may require a different
X for different architecures to the extent that different data layouts
and loop nest order. All these parallel and performance feautures
break the data abstraction of the separation of concerns between the
maths/science code and architecture specific code. 

This is problematic for several reasons
